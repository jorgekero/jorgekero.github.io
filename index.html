				<h1>Jorge Gamboa</h1>
				<p>Data Analytics enthusiast. Environmental Analyzer Engineer. Marathon runner. Amateur Crossfit Athlete.</p><br>
				<h1>About</h1>
				<h3>Favorite Quote: "To measure is to know. If you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it" - <em> Lord Kelvin </em></h3><br>
				<p>Patient and willing to learn. I passionately believe that data analysis solves most of the scientific, business and personal problems.</p><br>

				<p>I am used to the idea of training and learning one step at a time. From running Marathons, which require months of preparation, 
				to the idea of going from "Scaled" to "Rx" in Crossfit. I had to set a goal and Google wasn't giving me a consistent target to 
				aim for to improve my numbers. So my curiosity led me down the path of data analytics and visualization to extract insights from a 
				large database of Crossfit athletes statistics and thus evaluate how far I was from the average Crossfitter.</p><br>

				<p>In 2022, I've learned a lot about Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The COVID-19 pandemic brought many changes 
				to our work and study environments. Therefore, a business institute wanted to evaluate how students felt about the in-person and remote class formats.
				In this way, a project was presented to evaluate which format they prefer through surveys and Sentiment Analysis of the students' comments.</p> <br>

				<p>I currently work as an environmental process analyzer engineer, which is a profession that includes chemistry, mechanics, electronics, statistics 
				and a little of <b>black magic</b> to evaluate data of gas emissions from industries into the atmosphere. The insights generated by this data can reduce 
				emitted pollution levels, efficiently control industrial processes and save a plant from paying millions of dollars in fines and penalties. </p><br>
